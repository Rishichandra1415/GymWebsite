# PulseFit Gym — Pro Frontend
A clean, professional, responsive static site for a gym. Built with **HTML + CSS + JS**, no frameworks. Drop-in replacement for your `gym-site` repo.

## Files
- `index.html` — Landing page with hero, programs, pricing, trainers, gallery, and contact section.
- `contact.html` — Contact page with form and map.
- `assets/styles.css` — Modern, themed styles (dark + light).
- `assets/script.js` — Mobile menu, year, theme toggle.

## How to use
1. Replace your repo’s files with these, or copy the `gym-pro-site` folder contents into your project.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Update copy, prices, and images to your brand.
4. The contact form uses Formspree as a placeholder. Replace `action` URL with your backend or a new Formspree endpoint.

## Notes
- Color variables are in `:root`. Tweak `--brand` and `--brand-2` to match your brand.
- Images use Unsplash placeholders — replace with `/images/*` from your repo if you prefer.
